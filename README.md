# British Airways Internship Project .Task 1
# Introduction
With the advancement of technology, customers today have access to a wide range of information at their fingertips, fundamentally changing the way the purchasing cycle works. In the airline industry, this shift means that being reactive — hoping customers book their holidays as they arrive at the airport — is no longer sufficient. To stay competitive, airlines must be proactive and acquire customers before they even embark on their holidays. Predictive models, powered by high-quality data, provide the key to achieving this goal.

This task revolves around using customer review data to predict the likelihood of a customer purchasing flights or holidays from British Airways. By preparing the dataset and training a machine learning model, we aim to assess which factors influence the customers' purchase decisions and how these insights can help British Airways acquire customers earlier in the decision-making process.

# Objective
The primary objective of this project is to develop a machine learning model that predicts customer ratings based on their reviews. By leveraging the information from customer feedback, the model will help us understand which features play a key role in shaping customer satisfaction and purchasing decisions. This predictive capability can then be used to target marketing efforts more effectively, ensuring that British Airways can proactively engage customers before their travel decisions are made.

# Data Overview
The dataset consists of several key columns:

Reviews: Customer feedback on their flight experience.

Stars: Customer ratings (on a scale of 1-10).

Date: The date when the review was posted.

Country: The country where the review was submitted from.

Verification Status: Whether the review is verified (yes or no).

These features provide a rich source of information that can be used to predict customer satisfaction and identify patterns that could inform marketing strategies.

# Methodology
The process will involve several key steps:
1. Data Preparation: Clean and preprocess the data to make it suitable for machine learning. This includes handling missing values, encoding categorical variables (e.g., "Country" and "Verification Status"), and ensuring the dataset is balanced.

2. Model Selection: Use a Random Forest Classifier to train a predictive model based on the dataset. Random Forests are well-suited for this type of classification task because they handle complex datasets, capture non-linear relationships, and provide insights into feature importance.

3. Model Evaluation: Once the model is trained, evaluate its performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and the F1-score. This will help assess how well the model can predict customer ratings and whether it’s a reliable tool for targeting potential customers.

4. Interpretation: Analyze the results to understand the contributions of each variable to the model’s predictive power. This insight will help British Airways focus on the key areas that drive customer satisfaction, ultimately improving their ability to acquire customers before they finalize their travel decisions.
