# British Airways Internship Project 
# Introduction

In today’s competitive airline industry, customer experience and satisfaction play a critical role in shaping brand loyalty and business growth. At British Airways, data scientists harness the power of analytics and predictive modeling to understand customer sentiment, identify service gaps, and support strategic decisions. This project explores customer reviews by analyzing patterns in star ratings, review content, and user verification status. The goal is to build a machine learning model that evaluates sentiment or satisfaction levels, offering insights that can help British Airways proactively engage with customers—even before their journey begins.
# Objective

The primary objective of this project is to leverage customer review data to build a machine learning model that can evaluate and predict customer satisfaction. By analyzing structured features such as star ratings, review dates, country of origin, and verification status, the model aims to uncover patterns that influence customer sentiment. These insights will help British Airways refine its customer engagement strategies, improve onboard and ground services, and ultimately enhance customer retention and acquisition efforts.
